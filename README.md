# intermezzOS RFCs

This is a “request for comments” repository for intermezzOS. Here’s the idea:
every design choice in intermezzOS must be justified through writing an RFC,
before it’s accepted that this is the path that we’ll take.

“Design choice” is a bit vague, but it’s basically any high-level choice. This
isn’t “every PR must be justified” but any sort of “Why is intermezzOS like
$x?” question should probably have an answer here.

## Process

To initially discuss a topic, open an issue. We’ll discuss things in those
issues.

When a proposal is ready to be made, submit a pull request adding a new file in
the `text` directory. We’ll discuss things in the PR, and then either merge or
not.
